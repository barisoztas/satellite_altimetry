# SENTINEL-3 Altimetry

Using SENTINEL-3 Altimetry data to monitor river and lake water levels. 

## Algorithm
Water level retrieval Algorithm published by Copernicus Global Land Service is used to create script. Overall, we tried to implement main elements in the Python environment with minor changes. Contact with me for more detailed explanation.

## Dates
Version 0.1: Created at 30-11-2021 \
Version 1.0: Updated at 08-12-2021 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can read from netCDF files and calculate the water surface height and print the results to command line \
Version 1.1: Update at 13-12-2021 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can read Sentinel 3 Measurements from netCDF files and export them to xlsx format. Calculate water surface height and print results to excel
Version 1.2: Update at 07-01-2022 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be adding different waveform retracking algorithms. Also, implementation of Jason 1-2-3 will be added soon. Stay tuned.
